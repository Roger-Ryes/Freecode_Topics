			<h2>Start a Working Express Server</h2>
			<p>In the first two lines of the file <strong>myApp.js</strong>, you can see how easy it is to create an Express app object. <br>
			One fundamental method is <strong>app.listen(port)</strong>. It tells your server to listen on a given port.<br>
			For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background so we added this method in the `server.js` file for you.
			</p>
			<p>In Express, routes takes the following structure:<br><strong>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)</strong><br>
			<strong>METHOD</strong> is an http method in lowercase.<br>
			<strong>PATH</strong> is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). <br>
			<strong>HANDLER</strong> is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. <br>
			Handlers take the form <strong>function(req, res) {...}</strong>, where req is the request object, and res is the response object.<br> Example
			</p>
			<p class="text-light text-center">
				function(req,res){<br>
					res.send("Response string");<br>
				}

			<h2>Serve an HTML File</h2>
			<p>You can respond to requests with a file using the <strong>res.sendFile(path)</strong> method. You can put it inside the <strong>app.get('/', ...)</strong> route handler. This method will set the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type.  Then it will read and send the file. <br> This method needs an absolute file path. We recommend you to use the Node global variable <strong>__dirname</strong> to calculate the path like this:</p>
			<p>
				absolutePath = __dirname + relativePath/file.ext
			</p>
			<p class="text-light">pathAbs = __dirname + "/views/index.html";<br>
				app.get("/",function(req,res){<br>
				  res.sendFile(pathAbs);<br>
				});

			<h2>Serve Static Assets</h2>
			<p>An HTML server usually has one or more directories that are accessible by the user.<br>
			You can place there the static assets needed by your application (stylesheets, scripts, images).<br>
			In Express, you can put in place this functionality using the middleware <strong>express.static(path)</strong>, where the <strong>path</strong> parameter is the absolute path of the folder containing the assets.
			</p>
			<p>Basically, middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information.<br>
			A middleware needs to be mounted using the method app.use(path, middlewareFunction). The first path argument is optional. If you don’t pass it, the middleware will be executed for all requests.
			</p>
			<p>
				Example<br>
				Mount the <strong>express.static()</strong> middleware for all requests with <strong>app.use()</strong>. The absolute path to the assets folder is <strong>__dirname + /public</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>app.use(express.static(__dirname+"public"))</p>

			<h2>Serve JSON on a Specific Route</h2>
			<p>While an HTML server serves HTML, an API serves data.<br> A REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API allows data exchange in a simple way. The client only needs to know where the resource is (the URL), and the action it wants to perform on it <strong>(the verb)</strong>.</p>
			<p>The GET verb is used when you are fetching some information, without modifying anything. The preferred data format for moving information around the web is JSON. JSON is a convenient way to represent a JavaScript object as a string, so it can be easily transmitted.</p>
			<p>Let's create a simple API by creating a route that responds with JSON at the path <strong>/json</strong>. You can do it with the <strong>app.get()</strong> method. Inside the route handler, use the method <strong>res.json()</strong>, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data. <br> 
			A valid object has the usual structure <strong>{key: data}</strong>.

			<h2>Use the .env File</h2>
			<p>The <strong>.env</strong> file is a hidden file that is used to pass environment variables to your application.<br>
			This file is secret, and it can be used to store data that you want to keep private or hidden.</p>
			<p>For example, you can store API keys from external services or your database URI. You can also use it to store configuration options. You can change the behavior of your application, without the need to rewrite some code.</p>
			<p>The environment variables are accessible from the app as <strong>process.env.VAR_NAME</strong>.
			The <strong>process.env</strong> object is a global Node object, and variables are passed as strings.<br>
			By convention, the variable names are all uppercase, with words separated by an underscore. 
			</p>
			<p>The <strong>.env</strong> is a shell file, so you don’t need to wrap names or values in quotes. It is also important to note that there cannot be space around the equals sign when you are assigning values to your variables, e.g.<br>
			<strong>VAR_NAME=value</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>Store the variable <strong>MESSAGE_STYLE=uppercase</strong> in the <strong>.env</strong> file. Then tell the GET <strong>/json</strong> route handler.<br>
			if <strong>process.env.MESSAGE_STYLE</strong> equals <strong>uppercase</strong>. The response object should become <strong>{"message": "HELLO JSON"}</strong>.

			<h2>Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware</h2>
			<p>you were introduced to the express.static() middleware function.<br>
			Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments:</p>
			<p class="text-light"><ol>
				<li>The request object.</li>
				<li>The response object.</li>
				<li>The next function in the application’s request-response cycle.</li>
			</ol></p>
			<p>These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects.<br>
			They can also end the cycle by sending a response when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This triggers calling the 3rd argument, <strong>next()</strong>.<br>
			Look at the following example:
			</p>
			<p class="text-light">
				function(req, res, next){<br>
					console.log("I´m a middleware...");<br>
					next();<br>
				}
			</p>
			<p>When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”, then it executes the next function in the stack.</p>
			<p>In this exercise, you are going to build root-level middleware. <br></p>
			<p class="text-light">
			To mount a middleware function at root level, you can use the <strong>app.use(mware-function)</strong> method.</p> 
			<p>In this case, the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use <strong>app.post(mware-function)</strong>. Analogous methods exist for all the HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …).</p>
			<p>Example<br>
				Build a simple logger. For every request, it should log to the console a string taking the following format: method path - ip.<br>
				You can get the request method (http verb), the relative route path, and the caller’s ip from the request object using <strong>req.method, req.path and req.ip</strong>. Remember to call <strong>next()</strong> when you are done, or your server will be stuck forever.

			<h2>Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server</h2>
			<p>Middleware can be mounted at a specific route using <strong>app.METHOD(path, middlewareFunction)</strong>. Middleware can also be chained inside route definition.<br>
			Look at the following example:</p>
			<p class="text-light">
				app.get("/user",function(req, res, next){<br>
					req.user = getTheUserSync();  // Hypothetical synchronous operation<br>
					next();<br>
				},function(req,res){<br>
					res.send(req.user);<br>
				});
			</p>
			<p>This approach is useful to split the server operations into smaller units. That leads to a better app structure, and the possibility to reuse code in different places.</p>
			<p>At each point of the middleware stack you can block the execution of the current chain and pass control to functions specifically designed to handle errors. Or you can pass control to the next matching route, to handle special cases.</p>
			<p><strong>Example</strong><br>
				In the route <strong>app.get('/now', ...)</strong> chain a middleware function and the final handler. In the middleware function you should add the current time to the request object in the <strong>req.time</strong> key. You can use <strong>new Date().toString()</strong>. In the handler, respond with a JSON object, taking the structure <strong>{time: req.time}</strong>.

			<h2>Get Route Parameter Input from the Client</h2>
			<p>When building an API, we have to allow users to communicate to us what they want to get from our service. For example, if the client is requesting information about a user stored in the database</p>
			<p>One possible way to achieve this result is by using route parameters. Route parameters are named segments of the URL, delimited by slashes <strong>(/)</strong>.<br>
				The captured values can be found in the <strong>req.params</strong> object.</p>
			<p class="text-light">
				route_path: '/user/:userId/book/:bookId'<br>
				actual_request_URL: '/user/546/book/6754'<br>
				req.params: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</p>
			<p>Example<br>
				Build an echo server, mounted at the route <strong>GET /:word/echo</strong>. Respond with a JSON object, taking the structure <strong>{echo: word}</strong>. You can find the word to be repeated at <strong>req.params.word</strong>.

			<h2>Get Query Parameter Input from the Client</h2>
			<p>Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark <strong>(?)</strong>, and includes <strong>field=value</strong> couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand <strong>(&)</strong>. </p>
			<p>Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object <strong>req.query</strong>. <br>
				If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.</p>
			<p class="text-light">
				route_path: '/library'<br>
				actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&bookId=6754'<br>
				req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</p><hr>
			<p>Example<br>
				Build an API endpoint, mounted at <strong>GET /name</strong>. Respond with a JSON document, taking the structure <strong>{ name: 'firstname lastname'}</strong>. The first and last name parameters should be encoded in a query string e.g. <strong>?first=firstname&last=lastname</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong>If you want, you can use the method <strong>app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler)</strong>. This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route.</p>

			<h2>Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests</h2>
			<p>Besides GET, there is another common HTTP verb, it is POST. POST is the default method used to send client data with HTML forms. In REST convention, POST is used to send data to create new items in the database</p>
			<p>In these kind of requests, the data doesn’t appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. The body is a part of the HTTP request, also called the payload. Even though the data is not visible in the URL,<br>
				To see why, look at the raw content of an HTTP POST request:</p>
			<p class="text-light">
				POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0<br>
				From: john@example.com<br>
				User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0<br>
				Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>
				Content-Length: 20<br>
				<br>
				name=John+Doe&age=25</p>
			<p>As you can see, the body is encoded like the query string. This is the default format used by HTML forms. With Ajax, you can also use JSON to handle data having a more complex structure. </p>
			<p>There is also another type of encoding: multipart/form-data. This one is used to upload binary files. In this exercise, you will use a urlencoded body. To parse the data coming from POST requests, you have to install the <strong>body-parser</strong> package. </p>
			<p><hr>Example<br>
			Install the <strong>body-parser</strong> module in your <strong>package.json</strong>. Then, <strong>require</strong> it at the top of the file. Store it in a variable named <strong>bodyParser</strong>. The middleware to handle urlencoded data is returned by <strong>bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false})</strong>. Pass to <strong>app.use()</strong> the function returned by the previous method call. 
			<br>
			<strong>Note: extended=false</strong> is a configuration option that tells the parser to use the classic encoding. When using it, values can be only strings or arrays.

			<h2>Get Data from POST Requests</h2>
			<p>Mount a POST handler at the path <strong>/name</strong>. It’s the same path as before. We have prepared a form in the html frontpage.<br>
				If the body-parser is configured correctly, you should find the parameters in the object <strong>req.body</strong>. Have a look at the usual library example:</p>
			<p class="text-light">route: POST '/library'<br>
				urlencoded_body: userId=e546&bookId=6754<br>
				req.body: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</p>
			<p>Test if your endpoint works using the html form we provided in the app frontpage.<br>
				<strong>Tip:</strong> There are several other http methods other than GET and POST. And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb, and the operation you are going to execute on the server. The conventional mapping is:</p>
			<p>POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,
				<br>
				GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,
				<br>
				PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,
				<br>
				DELETE => Delete a resource.</p>
